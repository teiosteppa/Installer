# Hachimi Installer for Steam
Simple installer for Hachimi, adapted for use with the Steam version of Umamusume: Pretty Derby (JP). Built against the latest DLLs from [kairusds/Hachimi-Edge](https://github.com/kairusds/Hachimi-Edge).

# Usage
The installer supports both GUI and CLI/Unattended mode. To start in GUI mode, just launch the application without any arguments.

## CLI
- Usage: `hachimi_installer.exe [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>`
- Subcommands:
    - install
    - uninstall
- Options:
    - `--target <filename or path>`: Specifies the install target, relative to the install dir. If it's an absolute path, the install dir will be ignored.
    - `--explicit-target <filename>`: Explicitly specifies the specific target name, regardless of the target's path. This option influences the install method that will be used.
    - `--install-dir <path>`: Specifies the install directory.
    - `--sleep <milliseconds>`: Duration to sleep before starting the install process.
    - `--prompt-for-game-exit`: When enabled, the installer will display a dialog prompting the user to close the game if it is running. The dialog will continue to display until the user closes the game, or cancel the install process.
    - `--pre-install`: Also run pre-install checks. Ignored when uninstalling.
    - `--post-install`: Also run post-install tasks. Ignored when uninstalling.
    - `--launch-game`: Launch the game after the operation finishes successfully.
    - `--`: Arguments separator; any arguments put after it will be passed onto the game when using `--launch-game`.
